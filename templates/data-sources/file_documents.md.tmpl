# Data Source: kubectl_file_documents

This provider provides a `data` resource `kubectl_file_documents` to enable ease of splitting multi-document yaml content.

## Example Usage

### Example Usage with for_each

The recommended approach is to use the `manifests` attribute and a `for_each` expression to apply the found manifests. This ensures that any additional yaml documents or removals do not cause a large amount of terraform changes.
