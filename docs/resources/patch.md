# Patch (Resource)

Patches an existing Kubernetes resource using Server-Side Apply. Unlike `kubectl_manifest`, this resource does not manage the full lifecycle of the target — it only applies and reverts a targeted patch. Use this to add labels, annotations, or modify specific fields on resources managed outside of Terraform.

## Schema

### Required

- `api_version` (String) Kubernetes API version of the target resource (e.g., `v1`, `apps/v1`).
- `kind` (String) Kubernetes resource kind of the target resource (e.g., `ConfigMap`, `Deployment`).
- `name` (String) Name of the target Kubernetes resource.
- `patch` (Dynamic) An object containing the fields to patch on the target resource. This is merged into the target using Server-Side Apply. For example, to add a label: `{ metadata = { labels = { "my-label" = "my-value" } } }`.

### Optional

- `field_manager` (Block List) Configure field manager options for server-side apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_manager))
- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the target Kubernetes resource. Omit for cluster-scoped resources.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Composite identifier in the form `apiVersion//kind//name[//namespace]`.
- `object` (Dynamic) The full resource object after the patch has been applied.

### Nested Schema for `field_manager`

Optional:

- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) Force changes against conflicts. Default: `false`
- `name` (String) The name to use for the field manager. Default: `Terraform`

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
